## About Me

I’m a second-year Electronics and Computer Science student with a strong interest in building **complete, working systems**, not isolated demos.

My work spans:
- Embedded systems and IoT
- Hardware–software integration
- Modern web development for user-facing control and visualization

I enjoy translating **low-level electronics and system logic** into reliable, user-facing applications while dealing with real-world constraints like debugging, performance, and deployment.

Currently focused on strengthening my fundamentals through **project-based learning** and **open-source contributions**.
