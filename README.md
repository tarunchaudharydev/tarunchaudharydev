## 🚀 About Me

I’m a second-year Electronics and Computer Science undergraduate at **GLA University**, focused on building **reliable, real-world systems** that bridge hardware and software.

I work across embedded systems, IoT, and modern web development, with a strong interest in **hardware–software co-design**. Rather than treating hardware and software as separate layers, I enjoy integrating them into complete, usable solutions that account for real-world constraints like performance, reliability, and deployment.

Currently, I’m strengthening my fundamentals through **project-based learning**, hands-on experimentation, and **open-source contributions**, while steadily improving my ability to design, debug, and ship end-to-end systems.
